#Getting Started with a Large Grid in Reagent
This code compares Reagent and Om, two ClojureScript frameworks for Facebook React.  In this project we build a simple data table using [Reagent](http://holmsand.github.io/reagent) coupled with a datasource from a prior blog article.  For more details visit the article [Website Design in Reagent](https://thebhwgroup.com/blog/2015/03/website-dev-clojure-reagent).  The article discusses some of the syntax and design differences from Om as well as some common depencency problems new Clojure and ClojureScript developers may encounter.

This code was started from the leiningen template [reagent-template](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent-template).

This code uses a 2014 World Cup datasource built in a previous blog [article](https://thebhwgroup.com/blog/2014/09/bi-nodejs-couchdb-mapreduce).
