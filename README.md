#Reagent Performance Testing
This code is used in a The BHW Group blog article comparing the performance of AngularJS and React.js using JavaScript as well as ClojureScript.  In this project we build a simple data table using [Reagent](http://holmsand.github.io/reagent).

This code started from the leiningen template [reagent-template](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent-template).
